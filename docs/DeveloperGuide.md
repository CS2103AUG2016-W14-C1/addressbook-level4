## 1. Introduction

Remindaroo is an activity manager that helps users track tasks, deadlines, as well as events. It is a **Java CLI** application with a basic **GUI**.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Remindaroo. It aims to help you understand how Remindaroo works and how you can further contribute to this project. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner to help you comprehend the big picture before proceeding on to more detailed sections.

## 2. Setup

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes

## 3. Design
### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
> Figure 1: _Architecture Diagram_, which explains the high-level design of the App.


**Quick Overview of Components**

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/MainApp.java). When the user starts up the program, `MainApp` initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other. When the user exits the program, `MainApp` shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

Two of those classes play important roles at the architectural level
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained)) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many other classes to write log messages to the App's log file

The rest of the App consists four components
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Gets input from the user and display results to the user
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Interprets user input and executes command accordingly
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from the hard disk and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteActivity.png" width="800">

> Figure 2: _Sequence Diagram_ of how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ActivityManagerChangedEvent` when the Activity Manager data are changed, instead of asking  `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteActivityEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Figure 3: _Sequence Diagram_ of how the `EventsCenter` reacts to `ActivityManagerChangedEvent`.

Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. Figures 2 and 3 show an example of how Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between `Model` and `Storage` components.

Each component is explained in greater detail below.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 4: _Class Diagram_ of UI component.

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ActivityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The UI component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

> Figure 5: _Class Diagram_ of Logic component.

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/logic/Logic.java)

The flow of `Logic` component is explained as follows.

* `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command
* `Parser` creates a `Command` object for `LogicManager` to execute
* The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an activity) and/or raise events
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`

<img src="images/DeleteActivitySdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 6: _Sequence Diagram_ for interactions within the `Logic` component for `execute("delete 1")` API call.

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

> Figure 7: _Class Diagram_ for Model component.

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* stores the ActivityManager data
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

> Figure 8: _Class Diagram_ for Storage component.

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component
* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the ActivityManager data in XML format and read it from XML.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.manager.commons` package.

## 4. Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`)

## 5. Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include
   1. _Unit tests_ that are checking for the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.manager.commons.UrlUtilTest`

   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking for the integration of multiple code units (assuming code units are working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.manager.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. _Hybrid tests_ that are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.manager.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running. See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## 6. Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

#### To create a new release

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Remindaroo depends on the [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. These _dependencies_ can be automatically managed using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives:

a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
