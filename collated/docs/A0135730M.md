> Figure 7: _Class Diagram_ for Model component.

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* stores the ActivityManager data
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components

##### Note:<br><br>

	> Example: <br>
	> `add transfer window closing on 31 oct for 3 years` <br>
	> `add monthly meeting from 1 Oct 1pm to 1 Oct 3pm for 5 months` <br>
	>

	> Figure 5: After entered command `add afternoon run from today 5pm to today 6pm for 5 days`<br><br>

-  If activity name contains keywords, add quotation marks to the keywords that separate the name and time.
	> Example: <br>
	> `add read All by Me "by" 23 Oct` <br>
	> `add screening from Tokyo to Paris "from" 21 Oct "to" 23 Oct` <br>
