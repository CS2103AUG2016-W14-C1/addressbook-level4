> Figure 7: _Class Diagram_ for Model component.

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* stores the ActivityManager data
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components
