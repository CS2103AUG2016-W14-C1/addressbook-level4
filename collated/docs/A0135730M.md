## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations. Some important details to utilize logging features are as follows:

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
* The Logger for a specific class can be obtained using the method`LogsCenter.getLogger(class)`, which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Log messages are currently displayed via console and is recorded in a `.log` file


**Logging Levels**

The various logging levels are as follows:
* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may cause the application to terminate
* `WARNING`: Application can still be used, but proceed with caution
* `INFO`: Information showing noteworthy actions occurring in Remindaroo
* `FINE`: Details that are less noteworthy but could be useful in debugging

### 4.2 Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled through the configuration file, such as the application name and logging level. The default file is `config.json`.

## 5. Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.<br>

To perform testing in eclipse:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

> Note: <br>
> If you have the Eclemma plugin installed, you may instead choose Coverage As > JUnit Test instead to obtain code coverage results.


**Using Gradle**:
To perform testing using Gradle, please refer to [this](UsingGradle.md) guide on using Gradle.


We have 2 types of tests as follows:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are system tests that test the entire application by simulation user actions on the GUI. These tests are found in the `guitest` package.

> Note: <br>
> Thanks to the TestFX library, GUI tests can be run in headless mode. In headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. Please refer to the guide on using Gradle for running tests in headless mode.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include:
   * _Unit tests_ that check the lowest level methods and classes
      e.g. `seedu.manager.commons.ConfigUtilTest`

   * _Integration tests_ that check for proper integration of multiple code units
      e.g. `seedu.manager.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   * _Hybrid tests_ that check multiple code units and how well they are connected with each other
      e.g. `seedu.manager.logic.LogicManagerTest`
