## 1. Introduction

Remindaroo is an activity manager that helps users track tasks, deadlines, as well as events. It is a **Java CLI** application with a basic **GUI**.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Remindaroo. It aims to help you understand how Remindaroo works and how you can further contribute to this project. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner to help you comprehend the big picture before proceeding on to more detailed sections.

## 2. Setup

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 4: _Class Diagram_ of UI component.

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ActivityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The UI component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

## 5. Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include
   1. _Unit tests_ that are checking for the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.manager.commons.UrlUtilTest`

   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking for the integration of multiple code units (assuming code units are working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.manager.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. _Hybrid tests_ that are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.manager.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running. See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

### C. Non-Functional Requirements
1. Should work on any [mainstream OS](#mainstream-os) as long as it has Java 8 or higher installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 activities.
3. With the exception of any cloud integration, the application should work offline
4. Should be able to work with only keyboard input

### D. Product Survey
We have surveyed a total of 4 task manager products and noted some of their strengths and weaknesses.

#### Google Calendar

<img src="images/GoogleCalendarScreenshot.png" width="800"><br>

> Figure 9: Screenshot of GoogleCalendar

**Pros:**

1. Ability to see all events at a quick glance
2. Ability to group events based on different categories
3. Ability to share schedules and integrate calendars of different users

**Cons:**

1. Difficult to modify existing events
2. Unable to add floating tasks (events without a date)

#### WunderList

<img src="images/WunderListScreenshot.png" width="800"><br>

> Figure 10: Screenshot of WunderList

**Pros:**

1. Ability to mark events as high priority with a star
2. Ability to place tasks in categories (in the form of nested folders)
3. Ability to have a collaborative folder where different users can add tasks

1. Unable to view a list of tasks within a specified time period
2. Difficult to determine a free slot within a specified time period

## <br> 4. Commands

> Format notations:
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters
> * Items in `[SQUARE_BRACKETS]` are optional
> * Keywords with `|` in between indicates that either one can be used
> * Order of parameters are fixed

<br>

> Special note on Date and Time parameters:
>
> `DATE_TIME`, `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` are parameters that can accept various inputs indicating a specific date or time. Some examples are as follows
> * Date, e.g. `29 Oct`
> * Date and time, e.g. `10 Nov 09:00`
> * Relative day, e.g. `tomorrow`
> * Specific weekday, e.g. `wednesday`
>

> Note: If the timing is not specified, it will be set as the current timing.
> Note: START_DATE_TIME must be earlier than or equal to END_DATE_TIME.

### <br>4.1 Add New Activity : **`add`**
Adds an activity into Remindaroo. 3 types of activities are available:
* _floating task_ : one without specific time
* _deadline_ : one with just a specific time
* _event_ : one with a start time and end time

##### Formats:<br><br>
-  `add FLOATING_TASK`<br>

	> Example: <br>
	> `add buy milk` <br>
-  `add DEADLINE on|by DATE_TIME`<br>

	> Example: <br>
	> `add Submit Assignment 1 on 23 Oct` <br>
	> `add Submit Assignment 1 by 23 Oct 09:00` <br>

- `add EVENT from START_DATE_TIME to END_DATE_TIME`<br>

	> Example: <br>
	> `add Football Tournament from 21 Oct 08:00 to 23 Oct 22:00` <br>
	> `add Football Tournament from 21 Oct to 23 Oct` <br>

Note: If activity name contains keywords, add quotation marks to the keywords that separate the name and time.
> Example: <br>
> `add read All by Me "by" 23 Oct` <br>
> `add screening from Tokyo to paris "from" 21 Oct "to" 23 Oct`

### <br>4.2 View Activities : **`view`**
Displays the details of the activity / activities<br><br>

- `add EVENT from START_DATE_TIME to END_DATE_TIME`<br>

	> Example: <br>
	> `add Football Tournament from 21 Oct 08:00 to 23 Oct 22:00` <br>
	> `add Football Tournament from 21 Oct to 23 Oct` <br>
