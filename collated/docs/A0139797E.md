## 1. Introduction

Remindaroo is an activity manager that helps users track tasks, deadlines, as well as events. It is a Java command line interface (CLI) application with a basic graphic user interface (GUI).

This guide describes the design and implementation of Remindaroo. It provides further details related to Remindaroo’s development, allowing you to better contribute to our project. We have organized this guide in a top-down manner to help you comprehend the bigger picture before proceeding on to more detailed sections.

### 3.3 Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 5: _Class Diagram_ of `Logic` component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/logic/Logic.java)

The logic component is implemented as a façade for easy manipulation of the other components. `Logic` uses the `AMParser` class to parse the user command. `AMParser` then creates a Command object for `LogicManager` to execute. Command execution may modify the Model and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object. An example can be found in Figure 6 below:

<img src="images/DeleteActivitySdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
Figure 6: Sequence diagram for `Logic` component interactions for `execute(delete 1)` API call

The various commands such as `AddCommand` and `UpdateCommand` are implemented using the factory pattern in the `AMParser` class. `AMParser` produces a new specific `Command` type from user input given in the `CommandBox`.

The `Command` class is also used as part of the command pattern. Notice how `ActivityManager` represents the state of our application. Therefore, `UI` acts as a client that leads to the execution of a `Command`, determined by `AMParser`. The `Model` then acts as a receiver to change `ActivityManager` itself.

### 3.4 Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 7: _Class Diagram_ for `Model` component

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the `ActivityManager` data
* Exposes an `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be ‘observed’. This is bound to the UI for automatic graphical updates
* Does not depend on any of the other three components

The `Model` component is managed by the `ModelManager` class. `ModelManager` keeps track of a history of the state of `ActivityManager` upon the execution of state-changing commands (such as `AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand`). `historyIndex` tracks the current state of `ActivityManager` and is used in `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`.

Each `ActivityManager` can hold a list of activities. An `Activity` has attributes such as a name, `Status` and can have up to 2 `AMDate` objects. The `AMDate` class is implemented using the façade pattern for the underlying [Natty](http://natty.joestelmach.com/) library, and is responsible for the automatic recognition and handling of user-defined date and time values. All internal operations related to `AMDate` such as storage are done in the epoch time format.

### 3.5 Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 8: _Class Diagram_ for `Storage` component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* Saves `UserPref` objects in JSON format and reads it back
* Saves `ActivityManager` data in XML format and reads it from XML

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components, such as `UnmodifiableObservableList`, can be found in the `seedu.manager.commons package`.

### A. User Stories

<br>

User stories are high-level definitions of requirements containing enough information to be implemented in Remindaroo. They are assigned priorities as follows:
* `***` : High (Must-have feature)
* `**` : Medium (Nice to have feature)
* `*` : Low (Unlikely to have feature and remains not implemented)

<br>

| Priority | As a | I want to | So that I can |
| -----|-----|-----|-----|
| *** | User | Add an activity |Keep track of important activities or tasks to complete
| *** | User | Remove all activities | Clean up a data file if required |
| *** | User | View all activities |Know the next few activities which needs to be completed
| *** | User | Update an activity | Make changes to an activity |
| *** | User | Delete an activity | Remove cancelled activities|
| *** | User | Undo a command | Revert an unintended change made to my schedule |
| *** | User | Search for activities | Find activities based on description, time and status |
| *** | User | Mark an activity as done | Check off a completed activity |
| *** | User | Change the storage file | Store my schedule in a more convenient location
| *** | User | Access the help menu | Refer to a list of commands available
| *** | User | Exit application | Free up computational resources
| ** | User | Load schedule from a file | Recover my schedule from existing backups |
| ** | User | Redo a command | Undo an accidental undo |
| ** | User | Add recurring activities | Add the same activity repeatedly in a single command |
| ** | User | Unmark an activity | Revert marking of completed activity back to pending activity |
| * | User | See suggestions | Know what to type next easily |


### B. Use Cases

Use cases are lists of actions that define the interaction between a user and Remindaroo. This section details the use cases that we have considered.

## 3. Commands

There are many commands in Remindaroo that you can take advantage of. Formatting notations used in Remindaroo are as follows:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be specified.
* Items in `[SQUARE_BRACKETS]` are optional parameters.
* Keywords with the character `|` in between indicates that either one can be used.
* Order of parameters specified are fixed.
* Keywords in Remindaroo are case-insensitive.

> **Note:**<br>
> An unrecognized command will be highlighted in red. Additionally, command words are case-insensitive as well.<br>

In addition, date and time parameters are also supported. `DATE_TIME`, `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` are parameters that can accept a variety of inputs indicating a specific date and/or time. Some examples include:
* Date, e.g. `29 Oct`
* Date and time, e.g. `10 Nov 09:00`, `10 Nov 9am`
* Relative day, e.g. `tomorrow`, `tmr`
* Specific weekday, e.g. `Wednesday`, `wed`

> **Note:**<br>
> If the timing is not specified, it will be set as the current timing. Additionally, `START_DATE_TIME` must be earlier than or be the same as `END_DATE_TIME`.<br>

### <br>3.1 Add New Activity : **`add`**
Adds an activity into Remindaroo. 3 types of activities are recognized, namely:
* _Task_ : An activity without a specific time
* _Deadline_ : An activity with a specific time
* _Event_ : An activity with a specific start time and end time

##### Formats:<br>
**`add TASK`**<br>
**`add DEADLINE on|by DATE_TIME`**<br>
**`add EVENT from START_DATE_TIME to END_DATE_TIME`**<br>
**`add DEADLINE_AND_TIME|EVENT_AND_TIMES for NUM TIME_UNIT`**<br>

#####Examples:<br>

**\>\> `add buy milk`** <br>
Remindaroo has added buy milk into the task panel.<br>

**\>\> `add submit assignment 1 by 1 Nov 09:00`** <br>
Remindaroo has added “submit assignment 1” with a due date on 1st November, 9am.<br>

**\>\> `add Football Tournament from 1 Dec 08:00 to 1 Dec 10:00`** <br>
Remindaroo has added “Football Tournament” which will be held on 1st December, 8am to 10am.<br>

> **Note**<br>
> Deadlines and events that have passed will be highlighted red to alert you.<br>

### <br>3.9 Undo last command: **`undo`**
Reverts Remindaroo to the last changed state by undoing previous commands.

##### Format:<br>
**`undo [NUMBER_OF_TIMES]`**<br>

##### Example:
**\>\> `add buy carrot`**<br>
**\>\> `add buy potatoes`**<br>
**\>\> `undo 2`**<br>
The commands that add “buy carrot” and “buy potatoes” are being undone.

<img src="images/screenshots/undo_command.png" height="400"><br>
Figure 14: Undo two commands.<br>

> **Note:**<br>
> You can only undo commands used in the current session.

### <br>3.10 Redo last command: **`redo`**
Redoes a previously undone command.

##### Format:<br>
**`redo [NUMBER_OF_TIMES]`**<br>

##### Example:
**\>\> `redo`**<br>
The command to add “buy carrot” is being redone, thus adding a task.

<img src="images/screenshots/redo_command.png" height="400"><br>
Figure 15: Redo one command.<br>

> **Note:**<br>
> You can only redo commands that were just undone. If another command is entered after undo, then redoing a command is no longer possible.

```
