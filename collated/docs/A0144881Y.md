## 3. Design
### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
> Figure 1: _Architecture Diagram_, which explains the high-level design of the App.


**Quick Overview of Components**

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/MainApp.java). When the user starts up the program, `MainApp` initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other. When the user exits the program, `MainApp` shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

Two of those classes play important roles at the architectural level
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained)) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many other classes to write log messages to the App's log file

The rest of the App consists four components
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Gets input from the user and display results to the user
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Interprets user input and executes command accordingly
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from the hard disk and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

> Figure 2: _Sequence Diagram_ of how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ActivityManagerChangedEvent` when the Activity Manager data are changed, instead of asking  `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

> Figure 3: _Sequence Diagram_ of how the `EventsCenter` reacts to `ActivityManagerChangedEvent`.

Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. Figures 2 and 3 show an example of how Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between `Model` and `Storage` components.

Each component is explained in greater detail below.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

> Figure 5: _Class Diagram_ of Logic component.

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/logic/Logic.java)

The flow of `Logic` component is explained as follows.

* `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command
* `Parser` creates a `Command` object for `LogicManager` to execute
* The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an activity) and/or raise events
* The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`

## 4. Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`)

## 6. Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

#### To create a new release

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Remindaroo depends on the [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. These _dependencies_ can be automatically managed using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives:

a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

## 6. Troubleshooting

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A:** Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Remindaroo folder.
