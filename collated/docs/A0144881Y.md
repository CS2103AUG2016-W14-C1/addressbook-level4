## 2. Setup

The prerequisites to develop Remindaroo are as follows: <br><br>

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    >Note: <br>
    >  Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
    > Note: <br>
    > Eclipse Neon is required. This app will not work with older versions of Eclipse.

3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))

4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace

In addition, we also recommend the following software to assist you in development:<br>

1. Eclemma plugin for Eclipse to analyse test coverage locally<br>
2. SourceTree to improve your Git workflow experience<br>

In order to import the project into Eclipse, proceed with the following steps:

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
2. Open Eclipse (in the prerequisites above)
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory (your clone's location)
6. Click `Finish`

  > Note:<br>
  > If you are asked whether to `keep` or `overwrite` config files, choose to `keep`.

  > Note:<br>
  > Depending on connection speed, it might take up to 30 mintues to complete setup.

## 6. Dev Ops

### 6.1 Build Automation

Do refer to our [guide](UsingGradle.md) on using Gradle for more information regarding build automation.

### 6.2 Continuous Integration

We use Travis CI to perform continuous integration on our projects. Do refer to the [guide](UsingTravis.md) on using Travis for more details.

### 6.3 Making a Release

To create a new release:
* Generate a JAR file using Gradle
* Tag the specific commit (usually the latest) in the Github repository with a version number, e.g. `V0.1`
* [Create a new release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) on Github and upload the JAR file you created

### 6.4 Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Remindaroo depends on the Jackson library for XML parsing. These dependencies can be automatically managed using Gradle. Gradle can download these dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives:
* Include third-party libraries in the repository
* Require developers to download these libraries manually
