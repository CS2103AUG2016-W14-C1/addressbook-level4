### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
Figure 1: _Architecture Diagram_  <br>

With reference to Figure 1, the application is initialized via the `Main` component, which contains only the `MainApp` class. When the user starts up the program, `MainApp` initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other. When the user exists the program, `MainApp` shuts down the components and invokes clean-up method(s) where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.  Two particular classes play important roles at the architectural level:

* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained)) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many other classes to write log messages to the App's log file

The rest of the App consists four components:
* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component) : Gets input from the user and display results to the user
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component) : Interprets user input and executes command accordingly
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component) : Reads data from the hard disk and writes data to the hard disk

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

Figure 2: Sequence diagram of component interactions for command `delete 1` <br>

In figure 2, Model simply raises an ActivityManagerChangedEvent when data in ActivityManager is changed. It does not ask **`Storage`** to save any updates to the hard disk.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteActivityEventHandling.png" width="800">

Figure 3: Sequence diagram of handling `ActivityManagerChangedEvent` <br>

In Figure 3, the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage`. Figures 2 and 3 exemplifies how an event-driven approach reduces direct coupling between `Model` and `Storage` components.

Each component is explained in greater detail below.

### 3.2 UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
Figure 4: _Class Diagram_ of `UI` component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/Ui.java)

The UI component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as`CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay`. These parts, including the `MainWindow` class, inherit from the abstract     `UiPart` class and can be loaded using `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses the [JavaFX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html) UI framework. The layout of the various UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)


The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Observes a list of activities via the `UnmodifiableObservableList` class to be displayed in the application, hence adhering to the observer pattern.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application and updates the UI accordingly (e.g. via `ActivityListPanelUpdateEvent`)
